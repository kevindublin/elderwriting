## Elder Writing Project Static Site for Litquake

Began this over a weekend when I realized that the load times/downtimes, SEO, and Learnpress plugin were not worth the trouble on Wordpress now that we don't need it as an asynchronous solution for teaching now that synchronous learning was happening over Zoom.

Begin with this static version and now will slowly template things out to be updated via a static site generator and repo with proposed features for myself and/or whomever inherits the duties in the future.

### Proposed Features
- Opportunities page that uses JS to fetch submission opps from my API
- Multimedia page updated with video playlist of prompts
- Additional archive of previous anthologies
